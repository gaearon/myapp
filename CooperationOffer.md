Hi Dan,

Sorry for bothering you, my email with proposition of cooperation might get stuck in spam folder, thats why I'm trying to reach you in your natural environment, where we developers feel the most comfortable :)

My name is Bart and I‚Äôm following you from the very beginning of my professional career (I learned redux through your egghead course üòâ ). I‚Äôm organizing [Pick JS](http://pickjs.com) - an international conference for advanced JS developers in Katowice (Southern Poland). It is with great pleasure that I invite you to join us at Pick JS as a speaker. I strongly believe it would be a great opportunity to meet the people that value the knowledge you share in order to help people grow.

Let me tell you something more about the background of the event. 1.5 years ago, along with my friend Jacob, I started Gruba.IT foundation (in the local genre, ‚ÄûGruba‚Äù means ‚Äûcoal mine‚Äù). With heads full of ideas how to support the local community and help it grow faster, we wanted to share our experience that we had gained by being active members of the IT community. After a year and a half, we managed to gather one of the most active IT communities in Poland and organized two great conferences (Cloudyna ‚Äì [aftermovie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-ZIfIwITYM) and [photos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/CloudynaConf/photos/?tab=album&album_id=2598953193545186), meet.js Summit ‚Äì [aftermovie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRad-nVzNQI) and [photos](https://www.facebook.com/pg/meetjspl/photos/?tab=album&album_id=3111477002259471).

meet.js Summit 2019 was announced a success, but since the IT community is getting more and more mature and advanced, many attendees were requesting more demanding topics. And this is how we came up with the idea of inventing an international, challenging JS conference.

Frankly speaking, when thinking about great event stars, you were the first person that came to our minds. Personally, I watched almost all of your speeches and I know you‚Äôre delivering fantastic value. We all would be honored if you decide to be the keynote speaker of the Pick JS conference taking place on 8th May. What do you think about this opportunity? On what terms would you agree to come and speak at the conference?

Looking forward to hearing from you. My email addres is: bartek@gruba.it

PS There is another reason why Gruba.IT was brought into life‚Ä¶ The Upper Silesian district of Poland is absolutely breath-taking. We constitute a unique community. You must see it for yourself!
